# InfraredSpectraEvaluator
This Python script helps to evaluate IR spectral data by characterizing peaks and comparing them with to recollected and labeled library data.

Still a working project.
Things to work on are:
  -Complete the data table for spectra data
  -Filter peaks with less than 5% relative peak area.
  -Write into the Excel the comments from the data table as well.
  -Look for and implement more efficient BaseLine correction method.
  -Make a tkinter GUI for the program
